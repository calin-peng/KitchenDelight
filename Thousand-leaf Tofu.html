  <p class="text"><b>Ingredients</b>
  <br> Thousand-leaf Tofu, Green Onion, Ginger<br>Pork Belly Soy sauce, Yellow bean sauce, cooking wine
<br><b>Preparation</b>
<br>Slice the tofu and the pork belly.<br>Soak tofu in cold or warm water to soften it.<br>Slice the ginger.<br>Cut the green onion into segments
<br><b>Steps</b>
<br>Fry the tofu slices with oil or blanch them.Remove.<br>Frying with oil can make it more aromatic and can gives better texture, but simply blanching is also good(I tries in both ways and there's no huge difference)
<br>Add some oil, stir-fry the ginger until aromatic.<br>Add the pork, yellow bean sauce and soy sauce at 2.5:1 by volume. Fry until aromatic.
<br>Soy sauce is for colouring.
<br><i>You can remove the ginger then if you don't like them to be in the dish.</i><br>Add tofu slices and green onion. Add cooking wine ( no more than 1/2 tbsp).
<br>Fry until aromatic.<br>Enjoy!
