<i>My plan was to make Ratatouille but I failed at the last baking step, the vegetable sliced seemed undercooked, I believed that that was because I was using air fryer which does not have a slow-baking function as the oven does.
<br>However, this sauce base is perfect! It comes very well with the pasta.
<br>I may come back to it at some point in the future to complete my ratatouille project.</i>
