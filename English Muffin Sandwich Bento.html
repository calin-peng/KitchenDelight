    <b>Ingredients</b><br>English Muffin<br>Ground Pork/Chicken<br>Corn starch(optional), Black Pepper, Salt, Curry Powder<br>Egg
<br>Sliced Cheese<br>Butter
<br><b>Preparation</b><br>Crack the egg and beat, leave one egg white out for the next step<i>for traditional muffin sandwich we use whole egg, we beat it this time to let it better stand up to freezing and re-heating</i>
<br>Marinate the pork/chicken with egg white, starch, salt, pepper and curry powder
<br><b>Steps</b><br>Spray some oil into the pan, pour in beaten egg once heated.<i>I use pan with circular shape compartments. Egg ring works as well.</i><br>Let sit until cooked, flip and cook for another few second(light yellow is fine, don't char it)
<br>Move the egg to a plate. Add oil(perferably non-spray)<br>Scoop ground meat, put into the compartment, press and shape it with the spoon so it fits in the circle<br>for egg ring, shape before putting into the pan
<br>Cook over medium heat until golden brown. Flip and cook until golden brown.<br>Move to  a plate.
<br><u>Assembling</u><br>Spread butter onto the muffin , on the side that will be in contact with the ingredients
<br>This acts as a waterproof layer  to keep the muffin dry and fresh, you can put butter into microwave oven for about 10 seconds and stir it to make it easy to spread out.<br>Layer the egg, sliced cheese and meat patty in perferred order
<br>Wrap with parchment paper and put into the freezing layer of the fridge
<br><b><i>Before Serving</i></b><br>Move to the lower layer of the fridge 12h ahead(optional)<br>Heat in microwave oven for 2 minutes<br>Cook in air fryer(380F) for about 2 minutes
<br>Enjoy!
