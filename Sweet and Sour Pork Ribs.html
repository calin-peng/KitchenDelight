    <b>Ingredients</b><br>Pork Ribs<br>Bell Pepper, Onion, Garlic, Ginger<br>Ketchup, Soy Sauce(light/dark), Chicken Stock, Sugar<br>Corn Starch(optional)
<br><b>Preparation</b><br>Blanch the pork ribs, label as Bowl A<br>Dice the bell pepper and onion, label as Bowl B<br>Grate the garlic and ginger, label as Bowl C
<br><b>Steps</b><br>Add oil and Bowl B to the wok, stir-fry for 1 min<br>Add Bowl A, stir-fry until golden brown (or at least aromatic!), remove from the wok and label as Bowl D<br>Add oil and Bowl C, stir fry until aromatic
<br>Add ketchup and sugar, stir fry until aromatic<br>Add Bowl D, add chicken stock and water (approx.1:1), it should cover the ribs
<br>Add light soy sauce <br><i>We want the pork rib to get coloured, so</i><br>Add proper amount of dark soy sauce based on your observation on the ribs
<br>Stir well, simmer at medium heat with lid on for approx. 40 minutes, flip the pork ribs occasionally
<br><i>Ideally you will see the liquid almost completely evaporate and it will stick on to the ribs as you pick them up<br>
Otherwise you can simmer it for longer or to thicken it with starch water</i>
<br>Enjoy!
